><p>Juneteenth and the New Form of Slavery: A Brief Retrospect


    When slavery was finally outlawed in Texas in June 19, 1865, slavery seemed to finally be over; however, that was far from the truth.

    At the height of the conflict between the Northern and Southern regions of America in 1862, the respective governments of the Union and the Confederacy declared war.
    And they needed soldiers, desperately.
    In March 28, Jefferson Davis of the Confederacy proposed the Conscription Act, which would have forcefully sent young, bright men to kill and die in the deadly battlefield against their will for the Confederate State.
    It was a massive failure.
    When the Act was passed later that month, it was met with widespread opposition, violent protests, and massive outcry; deeming the act unenforcable and ineffective.
    It appears that the idea of forced military service seemed crazy to the freedom-loving people of early-America, yet both governments strived for it's succession.
    Consequently, when the Union government later followed suit, introducing it's own concription act, it had a similar effect; but this time, the government wouldn't give up so easily,
    and when a violent riot erupted in New York, burning buildings and killing 200 men, the men in Washington were not so easily swayed
    Those who were inspired by the freedom which was the very motivation for the founding of America eventually gave it up in silence.
    The key difference between the Union and the Confederacy were their forms of slavery, the reprehensible act of denying one's right to own themselves.
    In the Union, governments may own people, citizens not. In the Confederacy, an economically unwise ineffecient form of labor that was doomed to fail.
    And when the Confederacy fell in 1865, Texas' chains were forged.</p>
