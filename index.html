<p>When slavery was finally outlawed in Texas on June 19, 1865, slavery seemed to finally be over; however, that was far from the truth.
 At the height of the conflict between the Northern and Southern regions of America in 1862, the respective governments of the Union and the Confederacy–at long last–declared war.
 And they needed soldiers, desperately.
 On March 28, Jefferson Davis of the Confederacy proposed the Conscription Act, which would have forcefully sent young, bright men to kill and die in the deadly battlefield against their will for the Confederate State.
 It was a massive failure. 
 When the Act was passed later that month, it was met with widespread opposition, violent protests, and massive outcry; deeming the act unenforceable and ineffective.
  It appears that the idea of forced military service seemed crazy to the freedom-loving people of early-America, yet both governments persisted in their efforts to gain more power.
   Consequently, when the Union government later followed suit in introducing it's own conscription act, it had a similar effect;
  But this time, the government wouldn't give up so easily,
   And when a violent riot erupted in New York, burning buildings and killing 200 men, the men in Washington were not so easily swayed.
   Those who were inspired by the freedom which was the very motivation for the founding of America eventually gave it up in silence.
 One key difference between the Union and the Confederacy were their forms of slavery; the reprehensible act of denying one's right to own themselves: In the Union, the government may own people, citizens not, In the Confederacy, an economically unwise and inefficient form of labor that was doomed to fail.
 And when the Confederacy fell to the Union in 1865, Texas' chains were forged.</p>
